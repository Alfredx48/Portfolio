      <p>After a sudden turn of events in 2019 resulted in paraplegia, a new path was charted for me. Instead of acting as a constraint, it kindled a fierce passion for technology and coding. This unexpected transition allowed me to delve into the realm of programming, opening doors to challenges and growth opportunities I had not previously explored. From this, I've leveraged my passion to amass an array of programming skills, utilizing them to design and build complex and meaningful systems.</p>
      <p>My ability to adapt, remain resilient, and continuously evolve, even in the face of adversity, is a unique strength. This steadfastness, alongside my technical expertise, fuels my enthusiasm for contributing innovation and value within the vibrant realm of software development. Now, I stand eager and prepared to apply this combination of resilience and technical skills to new opportunities, aiming to make a meaningful difference in the dynamic field of software development.</p>
